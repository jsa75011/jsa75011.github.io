<p style="text-align:center"><b>Bobby Seale</b></p></div>
<p class="first" style="text-align:center"> Bobby Seale was born on October, 22 1936 in Dallas, Texas.
 As a child, his family moved to Oakland, California, where he attended Berkeley 
 High School. In 1955, he joined the U.S Air Force, but after a serious 
 altercation with a superior officer, he was discharged on the grounds 
 of bad conduct. In 1962, Seale enrolled into Oakland’s Merit College, 
 where he met Huey P. Newton at a protest rally to speak out against 
 the blockade of Cuba which was issued under the Kennedy Administration. 
 The two became close friends quickly, and bonded over their political 
 radicalism.</p><p style="text-align:center">In 1966, the two founded the Black Panther Party, and wrote 
 the “Ten-Point Program” to address educational, economic and social 
 issues facing the black community. During his fight for justice,
 Seale wrote a book entitled “Seize the Time: The Story of the Black 
 Panther Party and Huey P. Newton”, which was published in 1970. 
 He was arrested numerous times, and was indicted in 1969, 
 in Chicago, for the conspiracy to incite riots. 
 Then, again in 1969, he was charged with murder,
 but the charges were eventually dropped. 
 He continues to fight for change and remains an advocated 
 for black rights and social justice.

<p style="text-align:center"><b>Huey P. Newton</b></p>
<p class="first" style="text-align:center">Huey P. Newton, originally named Huey Pearce Newton, 
was born in Monroe, Louisiana on February 17, 1942. Newton’s father found great 
admiration in Louisiana’s governor at the time, Huey P. Long, and decided to name
 Newton after him. Newton found himself immersed in political activism early on, 
because his mother and father were both heavily involved in the NAACP(National Associatin for the Advancement of Colore People).
As a toddler, his family moved to Oakland, California. Newton later attended 
Oakland’s Merritt College, where he met Bobby Seale. Together they created 
the Black Panther Party for Self Defense in 1966.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">As a group, 
the Black Panther Party had a militaristic undertone, and actively 
engaged in patrols on the California streets, to monitor police 
brutally, in which they openly carried fire arms, and wore black 
leather jackets and black berets. In 1974, Newton fled to Cuba to avoid a murder
 trial, which was eventually dismissed after two years. 
Amidst the numerous allegations placed against him, Newton managed to 
return to the U.S and earned a Ph.D. in 1980, from the University of California,
 Santa Cruz in social philosophy. Then, on August 22, 1989, Newton was fatally shot
 in Oakland, California, ended one of the most powerful eras in Black American history.
